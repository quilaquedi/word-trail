Welcome to WordTrail - a tool for language learners.

Seen a word that looks familiar, but not quite sure? Here you can check for other places it appears in your booklist.

Try it out: click on a word that appears more than once in this text (for example, this one: **Welcome**).

Get started: select a text from the menu. (Open the menu by clicking the orange block on the lefthand side.)
